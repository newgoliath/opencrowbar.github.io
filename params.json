### The Crowbar Project\r\n\r\n
The Crowbar Project is an open Apache2 licensed framework to build complete, easy to use operational deployments for everyone. It allows for groups of physical nodes to be transformed from bare-metal into a ready state production cluster within hours. Specific applications include (but are not limited to) Ceph, Hadoop and OpenStack.\r\n\r\n
